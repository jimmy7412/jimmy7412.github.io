      <p>Have fun with it. They say everything looks better with odd numbers of things. But sometimes I put even numbers just to upset the critics. Put it in, leave it alone.</p>

      <p>And right there you got an almighty cloud. I sincerely wish for you every possible joy life could bring. Nice little fluffy clouds laying around in the sky being lazy. It's cold, but it's beautiful.</p>

      <p>Just let go - and fall like a little waterfall. Use what happens naturally, don't fight it. A little happy sunlight shining through there. A fan brush can be your best friend. You have to make almighty decisions when you're the creator.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="column2">
      <p>Fluff it up a little and hypnotize it. We'll put a happy little bush here. Just let your mind wander and enjoy. This should make you happy. These little son of a guns hide in your brush and you just have to push them out. It looks so good, I might as well not stop.</p>

      <p>How do you make a round circle with a square knife? That's your challenge for the day. Let's go up in here, and start having some fun Play with the angles. Once you learn the technique, ohhh! Turn you loose on the world; you become a tiger. Fluff that up. We don't have anything but happy trees here.</p>

      <p>Isn't that fantastic? You can just push a little tree out of your brush like that. Here we're limited by the time we have. That's what makes life fun. That you can make these decisions. That you can create the world that you want.</p>

      <p>And just raise cain. Sometimes you learn more from your mistakes than you do from your masterpieces. You create the dream - then you bring it into your world. Little short strokes.</p>
